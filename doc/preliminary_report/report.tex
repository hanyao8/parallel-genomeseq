\section{Introduction}

Genome sequencing has become a promising field tool that is hypothesized to facilitate researchers to find the root cause (and subsequently the cure) for a number of genetic diseases in the future. \cite{Maekinen.2015}

% Diviation from proposal
The investigation into three different algorithms in the initial proposal (see attached below) was discarded in favor of a more thorough and deeper look into one of them (namely Smith-Waterman). From a computer science perspective all of these algorithms are rather similar, consequently the team decided to focus its efforts on the one which is most relevant in the given domain.

\section{Parallelization strategy}
1) Fine-grained approach 

2) Coarse-grained approach
